# Bug:
The bug was a problem related with the CPU where the same img was used even if a different one was required/selected.

Turns out the problem has been fixed with commit [d8a24402c6a98b6a0a009c17befe08b81a04e7ed](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42/commit/d8a24402c6a98b6a0a009c17befe08b81a04e7ed). Therefore, there's no need to pull request :D.
